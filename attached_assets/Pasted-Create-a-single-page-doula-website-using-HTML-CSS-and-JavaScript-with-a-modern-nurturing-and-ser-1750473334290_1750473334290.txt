Create a single-page doula website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a modern, nurturing, and serene aesthetic inspired by professional doula services. The website should feature:

    Navigation Bar: A fixed top navigation bar with links ("Home", "About", "Services", "Pricing", "Testimonials", "Contact") that enable smooth scrolling to corresponding sections on the page. The navigation bar should have a clean, minimalist design with a soft color palette (e.g., muted pastels, warm neutrals, or gentle greens) and a subtle hover effect (e.g., underline or color change).
    Hero Section: A full-width hero section with a soothing background image of a serene natural scene (e.g., soft-focus flowers, a calm landscape, or a gentle birthing environment). Overlay bold, elegant typography with a welcoming headline (e.g., "Empowering Your Birth Journey with Compassion") and a short subheading. Include a prominent call-to-action button (e.g., "Learn More" or "Contact Essie") with a rounded, inviting design. Use a warm, earthy color scheme (e.g., blush pink, sage green, ivory) to evoke trust and comfort.
    About Me Section: A section featuring a vertical photo of Essie (placeholder image of a smiling, approachable woman in a natural setting). The photo should be aligned to the left or right, with text on the opposite side describing Essie’s passion for doula work, her qualifications, and her personalized approach. Use a clean, sans-serif font (e.g., Lora, Open Sans) for readability, with a soft background color (e.g., cream or light gray) and subtle decorative elements like a leaf icon or gentle wave border.
    Services Section: A section showcasing three to four doula services (e.g., Birth Doula, Postpartum Support, Childbirth Education) in a grid or card layout. Each service should have an icon (e.g., a heart, baby, or lotus flower), a brief title, and a short description. Use a harmonious color palette with accents in calming tones (e.g., dusty blue, lavender) and hover effects that slightly scale or highlight the cards for interactivity.
    Pricing Section: A section with a pricing table or cards for different service packages (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium). Each package should include a title, price, list of included services, and a "Book Now" button. Style the table/cards with clean lines, subtle shadows, and a professional yet warm aesthetic, using colors like taupe, soft coral, or muted teal. Ensure the layout is responsive for mobile viewing.
    Testimonials Section: A section with three to four client testimonials in a carousel or stacked layout. Each testimonial should include a quote, client name, and optional star rating. Use a soft, rounded design for quote boxes with a light background (e.g., pale peach or ivory) and elegant typography. Add subtle animations (e.g., fade-in or slide) for a dynamic yet gentle effect.
    Contact Section: A contact form with fields for name, email, phone, due date, and a message, plus a submit button. Style the form with a clean, minimal design, using rounded input fields and a soothing accent color (e.g., sage green). Include Essie’s contact details (email, phone) and a small map placeholder (optional). Add a footer with social media icons (e.g., Instagram, Facebook) in a monochromatic style.

Technical Requirements:

    Use HTML5 for semantic structure, CSS3 for styling (with Flexbox or Grid for responsive layouts), and vanilla JavaScript for smooth scrolling and interactive elements (e.g., carousel, form validation).
    Ensure the design is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
    Use a Google Font (e.g., Lora, Montserrat, or Open Sans) for typography to maintain a professional and approachable feel.
    Incorporate a color palette inspired by nature (e.g., sage green, blush pink, ivory, dusty blue, warm taupe) to create a calming, nurturing atmosphere.
    Add subtle animations (e.g., fade-in on scroll, hover effects) to enhance user experience without overwhelming the serene aesthetic.
    Host placeholder images on a free service (e.g., Unsplash) for the hero background and Essie’s photo, ensuring they align with the doula theme (e.g., natural, maternal imagery).

Design Aesthetic:
The website should feel calming, nurturing, professional, and empowering, with a modern yet organic vibe. Use soft, earthy colors, clean typography, gentle curves, and subtle textures (e.g., light gradients or linen backgrounds) to evoke warmth and trust. Avoid harsh contrasts or overly bold elements; prioritize a serene, supportive, and inclusive atmosphere that reflects the doula’s role in guiding families through pregnancy and birth.
