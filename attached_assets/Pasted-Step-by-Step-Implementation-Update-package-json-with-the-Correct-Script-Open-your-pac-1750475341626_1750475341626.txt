Step-by-Step Implementation:

    Update package.json with the Correct Script:
        Open your package.json file in Replit.
        Ensure the "scripts" section includes a dev script. Replace or add the following:
        json

    "scripts": {
      "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts"
    }
    This script uses cross-env to set the NODE_ENV to development and tsx to run the TypeScript file server/index.ts.

Install Missing Dependencies:

    In the Replit terminal, run the following commands to install required packages:
    text

    npm install --save-dev tsx cross-env
    npm install express
    This ensures tsx (for running TypeScript), cross-env (for environment variables), and express (for the web server) are available.

Verify Project Structure:

    Confirm that a file named server/index.ts exists in your Replit project. If it doesn’t, create it with a basic Express setup, e.g.:
    typescript

    import express from 'express';
    const app = express();
    const port = 3000;

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Welcome to Essie’s Doula Website');
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
    });
    Adjust the file path in the dev script if your entry file is named differently (e.g., app.ts).

Address Vulnerabilities (Optional but Recommended):

    Run the following to fix moderate severity vulnerabilities reported by npm audit:
    text

npm audit fix --force
Then re-run npm install to ensure a clean dependency tree:
text

    npm install

Run the Development Server:

    In the Replit terminal, execute:
    text

        npm run dev
        This should start the server. If successful, you’ll see a message like Server running at http://localhost:3000. Access it via the Replit preview URL.

Notes for Replit Environment

    Replit automatically handles port assignment, so if 3000 is unavailable, the script will adapt. The preview URL will reflect the correct port.
    If the server doesn’t start, check the Replit console for errors and ensure all files are saved.
    The fix assumes a basic Express setup. If your index.ts includes additional middleware or routes (e.g., for the doula website sections), ensure they are correctly implemented.

Expected Outcome

After implementing this fix, running npm run dev should launch a development server for your doula website, allowing you to test the application. If issues persist, please share the updated package.json or any new error messages, and I can refine the solution further.
